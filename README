Simple application that watches a directory (or many) and runs a command when it gets a (Mac OS X only) FSEvent

Needs 2 GEMs to work:

sudo gem install ruby-fsevent
sudo gem install ruby-growl

Change the variables at the top to do the right thing

You may need to stop and start growl a few times so it gets it right
