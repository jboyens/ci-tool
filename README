Simple application that watches a directory (or many) and runs a command when it gets a (Mac OS X only) FSEvent

Needs 2 GEMs to work:

sudo gem install ruby-fsevent
sudo gem install ruby-growl

Usage: ci-tool.rb [options]
    -d, --directory DIR              The directory that you wish to watch
	-c, --command COMMAND            The command to run
	-f, --failure FAILURE            The failure message
	-s, --success SUCCESS            The success message
	-h, --help                       Display this message


You may need to stop and start growl a few times so it gets it right
